# FILE HANDLING (TEXT FILES)

# 1) Reading full file
# with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
#     print(f.read())

# 2) Reading line by line
# with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
#     for line in f:
#         print(line.strip().title())

# 3) Writing (overwrite)
# with open("notes.txt", "w") as f:
#     f.write("Day 20: File Handling\n")
#     f.write("Learning read and write. \n")

# 4) Appending
# with open("notes.txt", "a") as f:
#     f.write("Appending new line. \n")

# 5) Cleaning data in file
# cleaned = []
# with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
#     for line in f:
#         cleaned.append(line.strip().title())
# with open("cleaned_output.txt", "w") as f:
#     for city in cleaned:
#         f.write(city + "\n")

# 6) Counting line
# "_" means each line
count = 0
with open("sample.txt", "r") as f:
    for _ in f:
        count += 1
print("Total Lines:", count)
