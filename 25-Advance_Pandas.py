# ADVANCED PANDAS (GroupBy, Filtering, Sorting)

import pandas as pd

# Load cleaned employee data
df = pd.read_csv("day24_Employee_Data.csv")

print("\n--- Data Loaded ---")
print(df.head())

# FILTERING

# Employees from Mumbai
df["City"] = df["City"].str.strip().str.title()
# mumbai_emp = df[df["City"] == "Mumbai"]
# print(mumbai_emp)

# High salary employees
# high_salary = df[df["Salary"] > 50000]
# print(high_salary)

# Multiple conditions
# mumbai_high = df[(df["City"] == "Mumbai") & (df["Salary"] > 50000)]
# print(mumbai_high)

# mumbai_pune = df[(df["City"] == "Mumbai") | (df["City"] == "Pune")]
# print(mumbai_pune)

# Using isin()
# IT_and_Finance = df[df["Department"].isin(["IT","Finance"])]
# print(IT_and_Finance)

# Advance Sorting

# Sort by Salary Descending
# df_sorted_salary = df.sort_values("Salary", ascending=False)

# Sort by Department then Salary
df["Department"] = df["Department"].str.strip().str.title()
# df_sorted_multi = df.sort_values(["Department", "Salary"], ascending=[True, False])
# print(df_sorted_multi)

# GROUP BY OPERATIONS

# Average salary by department
# avg_salary_dept = df.groupby("Department")["Salary"].mean()
# print(avg_salary_dept)

# Total salary by city
# total_salary_city = df.groupby("City")["Salary"].sum()

# Employee count by department
# emp_count_dept = df.groupby("Department")["Employee_ID"].count()

# Multiple aggregations
salary_stats = df.groupby("Department")["Salary"].agg(["min", "max", "mean", "count"])
print("\nSalary Stats:")
print(salary_stats)
